The students will examine the challenges of conducting 1) foundational and translation research (genetic/genomic and mechanistic research), 2) foundational and applications to clinical research 3) population and observational research (epidemiology, prospective clinical trials, retrospective studies), 4) pharmacologic research (the impact of pharmacology on the biomedical sciences). The students will examine relevant connections, consider conceptual relationships, and critically evaluate integrative issues germane to both the practice of and the innovative progress of veterinary medicine. Faculty members in the Departments of Aamp;P, DM/P, and CS, will present topical overviews, based on their professional experiences. This will be designed to connect and integrate fundamental principles and relationships between research and clinical application. These presentations provide examples of the fundamental requirements for clinical therapies and also provide examples of how innovative science leads to new therapies for long standing clinical disease. Additionally, students will learn the tools required to search relevant topic to their career paths within the medical literature. Finally, drawing on the multidisciplinary literature presented by faculty, students will explore the challenges in conducting genetic/genomic research, using genomic information, implementing research results to clinical practice, as well as addressing the social, legal, and professional policies that are emerging from new research. Students will be expected to do reading and to complete online worksheets and present their findings/opinions in class. Class time will be devoted to presentations and to discussion of readings and related current events.",

Social entrepreneurship is situated within a framework of social institutions, organizations, and entrepreneurial change in response to human and citizen rights and needs. The relevant social institutions include government, the market, education, philanthropy, and the family. Organizations may be for profit or non-profit, but all organizations, regardless of their legal structure, are seen to have a social purpose. Several non-market venues for sustainable social change will be examined in addition to the traditional delivery of goods and services through the market. The course provides a number of crucial tools and resources that may better orient and equip the prospective social entrepreneur to identify and act on opportunities.",

    "description": "This course seeks to fulfill the following objectives: (1) To provide the student with an awareness and mechanistic understanding of the effects of physical activity on humans and animals and the concept of homeostasis. (2) Foster an understanding of the integrative nature of kinesiology/physiology by considering the relationships among different systems and their response to stress in humans and animal species in health and disease. Focus is brought to bear in particular on the pulmonary, cardiovascular and muscle systems. Chronic and acute adaptations to special environments and physical stress are considered and the students are asked to consider the the different systems are controlled in health and disease. This course is recommended for pre-med students, biology and physiology majors, aspiring scientists in physiology and/or medicine and those interested in a career in health and human services.",
